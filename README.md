# ML_Breast_Cancer_Classifier
Analyze the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset using a decision tree classifier. Split data, build the model, assess accuracy, and determine optimal tree depth.

Project Description:

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset using a decision tree classification approach. The dataset consists of breast cancer cases with two distinct classes: benign and malignant. Our objectives are multifaceted:

Data Acquisition and Understanding: We will fetch and examine the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset, identifying the number of instances and features within it. Understanding the dataset's structure is critical for accurate analysis.
Data Preparation: We will split the dataset into training and test sets using the holdout method, ensuring a 60-40 split that reflects the class distribution of the entire dataset.
Model Development: A decision tree classifier will be constructed using entropy as the criterion for splitting nodes. We will restrict the splitting of nodes to those with six or more instances, optimizing for generalization and avoiding overfitting.
Model Evaluation: The model's accuracy will be verified against the test data to assess its performance.
Visualization: The decision tree model will be visualized to interpret the decision-making process and understand the feature importances.
